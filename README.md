# BoidChase

## Summary
This is a simple side project for me to practice both setting up game/engine projects and the boid flocking algorithm. It is only intended to be a demo, not a fully fledged game. In future, I may be using the engine for other demos.

I am using [The Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) as a guide for project setup and separation of concerns. It corresponds to a Youtube series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT).

## Running
If you want to run the demo, you will need to load the solution into visual studio, build both solutions, and run Game.cpp. The files should be set up to have the BoidGame project be default.
